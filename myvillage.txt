I am learning linux
My favorite flavour is redhat
This is a six month class
linux has many commands and some of them are pwd, ls, vi, cat, touch, mkdir
pwd stands for print working directory and it tells us where we are
ls help to list the content of a directoryvi is a text editor
touch helps to create files
mkdir helps to create directories
my favorite text editor is vi
we learned AWS few weeks ago
